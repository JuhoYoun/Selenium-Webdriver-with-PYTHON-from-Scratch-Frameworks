강의에서는 java war 파일을 받았지만 현재는 다운 받을 수 없고 나는 macos 전용으로 brew로 다운 받겠다

Jenkins can be installed using the Homebrew package manager. Homebrew formula: jenkins-lts This is a package supported by a third party which may be not as frequently updated as packages supported by the Jenkins project directly.

Sample commands:
Install the latest LTS version: brew install jenkins-lts
Start the Jenkins service: brew services start jenkins-lts
Restart the Jenkins service: brew services restart jenkins-lts
Update the Jenkins version: brew upgrade jenkins-lts
After starting the Jenkins service, browse to http://localhost:8080 and follow the instructions to complete the installation. Also see the external materials for installation guidelines. For example, this blogpost describes the installation process.
