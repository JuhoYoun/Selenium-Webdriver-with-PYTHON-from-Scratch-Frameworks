Mouse Interactions in Selenium

Mouse Hover - 마우스 커서를 웹 엘리먼트에 갖다 댐 

There is a class called ActionChains in Selenium which will help us to do that
action = ActionChains(driver)
Using this object, it will be able to perform all those interactions

ex)
action.click_and_hold(web element) -> long press
action.context_click(web element) -> right click
action.double_click(web element) -> double click
action.drag_and_drop(source, target) -> Holds down the left mouse button on the source element, then moves to the target element and release the mouse button
action.move_to_element(web element) -> just move mouse to that particular element

action.move_to_element(driver.find_element(By.ID,"mousehover")).perform() -> 이렇게 마지막에 .perform() 해줘야 실행된다
