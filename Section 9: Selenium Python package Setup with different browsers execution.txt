“chromedriver” can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.
->
The error message "“chromedriver” can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software" is a security feature on macOS called Gatekeeper. Gatekeeper prevents the execution of applications that are not from identified developers or have not been notarized by Apple.

To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:

Open the "System Preferences" on your Mac.
Click on "Security & Privacy."
In the "General" tab, you should see a message stating that "chromedriver" was blocked from opening.
Click on the "Open Anyway" button next to the message. You might need to enter your administrator password to authorize the change.
A confirmation prompt will appear, click "Open" to confirm and allow the "chromedriver" to run.
After completing these steps, you should be able to run the "chromedriver" without encountering the Gatekeeper error. However, please ensure that you download the "chromedriver" from a trusted source to ensure its integrity and security.
